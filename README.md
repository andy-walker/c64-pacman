But why?

Well, let me tell you a story ...

Long, long ago, there was a decade known as the 80s, and it was a sad, depressing time full of [big glasses](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/21/article-2118195-123D5C9F000005DC-239_310x517.jpg), [bad hair](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/21/article-2118195-123D5C9F000005DC-239_310x517.jpg) and [bad music](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/21/article-2118195-123D5C9F000005DC-239_310x517.jpg). And in the 80s, there lived a boy, who hated living in the 80s - and this boy was particularly worried he'd missed all the good music of the 60s and 70s - that was all over with now, and there would never be any good music ever again. And the little boy was sad about this.

Anyway, due to being a slightly annoying boy who asked a lot of questions, he got sent off to a summer camp one year - and at the summer camp he was forced to go swimming, and play sport, and do all sorts of activities he didn't want to do ..

Also, at about the same time .. [BBC Computer Literacy in Schools]

But .. [machine language - 80s - lack of information]

[Schools put us off 'IT' at high school]

Ok, ok - enough nostalgia already. Tell me about the code.
